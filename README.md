Project 2 - ETL mini project - ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and either using Python dictionary methods or regular expressions to extract and transform the data. 
            After we transformed the data, four CSV files got created and use the CSV file data to create an ERD and a table schema. Finally, youâ€™ll upload the CSV file data into a Postgres database.
